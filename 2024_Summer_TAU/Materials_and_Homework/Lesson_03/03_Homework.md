# 03 Homework

1. Sign up for Catma at: https://app.catma.de/seven/
2. Make a backup of the IAST Sanskrit document you prepared for the homework of Lesson 01.
3. On the IAST Sanskrit document, do a pada-vibhaga, that is: 1) space out the Sanskrit words when they are "stuck" together, 2) split compounds, 3) unsandhi each word in the split compunds (internal sandhi) and between separate words (external sandhi).
4. For assistance with the unsanshi process, use the following URL: https://sanskrit.inria.fr/DICO/reader.fr.html (make sure to change the "Input convention" to IAST). Note: this machine is not perfect and might have errors.
5. Upload the your work (in the form of a text file with ".txt" extension) to "Students" subdirectory in Lesson_03.
6. Look for a translation of the Sanskrit text you are working with, and have it available for next class (this would come handy).
